## How it works

The project is divided into two parts:

1. [Backend](https://github.com/C624-PS010/nusatawan-api)
2. [Frontend](https://github.com/C624-PS010/nusatawan-front-end)

But this repository is referring only to the Frontend part. Frontend need the Backend to be running to work.

[Git] (https://git-scm.com) 
[Node.js] (https://nodejs.org/en/).
In addition, it is good to have an editor to work with the code like [VSCode] (https://code.visualstudio.com/)

#### Running the web application (Frontend)

# Clone this repository

# Access the project folder in your terminal
$ cd nusatawan-front-end

# Install the dependencies
$ npm install

# Run the application in development mode
$ npm run dev

# The application will open on the port: 3000 - go to http://localhost:3000
